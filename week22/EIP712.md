## What pieces of information go in to an EIP 712 delimiter, and what could go wrong if those were omitted?

EIP712 is a standard for offchain signing.
Security risks include replay attacks and frontrunning attacks
There are a few components that are required for the signature digest such as

1. domain - including the name, version, chainId, optional salt and verifyingContract
2. Mail - the names included in teh transaction i.e. to and from

### Front Running

- EIP creates signatures over transaction, It's up to the verifying contract to ensure the user who created the signature makes the action. If it's a trade and the trade isn't protected from front-running, the signature & trade could be pickedup in the mempool and frontrun.

### Replay Attacks

- EIP712 creates signatures over transactions. It's up to the verifying contract to protect against replay attacks, especially if the protocol is cross-chain with the same contract address.

```json
    //
    struct EIP712Domain {
        string name;
        string version;
        uint256 chainId;
        address verifyingContract;
    }

    struct Person {
        string name;
        address wallet;
    }

    struct Mail {
        Person from;
        Person to;
        string contents;
    }
```

bytes32 digest = keccak256(abi.encodePacked("\x19\x01", DOMAIN_SEPARATOR, hash(mail)));

The response can be decoded using ecrecover to find the address that signed it.

### EIP details

sign(keccak256("\x19\x01" ‖ domainSeparator ‖ hashStruct(message)))
orderDigest = keccak256("\x19\x01" ‖ domainSeparator ‖ hashStruct(orderStruct))

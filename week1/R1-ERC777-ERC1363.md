# What problems ERC777, how does ERC1363 solve them?

ERC777 attack vectors include ambiguity whilst using the operator concept (Attack vector 1 below), opens for reentrancy attack or `MITM` style attack (Attack vector 2)
ERC1363 appears to have simplified the ERC777 operator concept by removing the ERC1820 registry style mapping by using simple hooks on transferring & receiving. ERC1363 can't send/receive to different address like ERC777 can but can't still use callbacks
Callbacks are useful for contracts receiving ERC20 tokens and executing something else in the hook, for example, receiving ERC20 and sending an NFT, or paying something

# ERC777

- ERC20 updates balances during transfer. aim is to reduce transaction count for transacting with ERC20
- `tokensReceived` fixes the 2 transactions for receiving ERC20 and swapping for eth

ERC777 makes a hook call on sending and receiving

1. hook call to address chosen by token sender
2. update balances
3. hook call to address chosen by token receiver

ERC777 implements the [ERC1820Registry](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1820a4B7618BdE71Dce8cdc73aAB6C95905faD24#code), a global registry
ERC1820 registry contains mappings of `preferred hook receivers` - it must register with ERC1820 with it's own address and interface

- Alice chooses Bob as receiver for tokens she's sent, Bob will receive a hook for every token Alice sends to the ERC777 contract
- Alice can choose John as a receiver for tokens Alice receives, John receives a hook call every token Alice receives from the ERC777 contract
- Alice can chose different hook receivers per each token
- the ERC1820 registry mapping maps (address, interfaceHash, address). If the contract ERC777 is implemented the same as everywhere else, it will have the same interface hash.

## Attack Vector 1

- some contracts have arbitrary calls, e.g. DEX aggregators, multicall contracts, etc
- an attacker can use a contract with an arbitrary call to set the ERC1820 mapping. e.g. Update registry (DEXContractAddress, hookHash, AttackerAddress)
- any call from the DEXContractAddress to an ERC777 contract with the same hookHash will notify the attacker address.
- Attacker can reenter in the target contract or revert a user transaction
  Solution: make sure the dex arbitrary functions can't call the ERC1820 address

## Attack Vector 2

- using `address operator` in `tokensReceived` adds ambiguity to who the original `msg.sender` is

# ERC1363

- functions `transferAndCall` & `transferFromAndCall` call the hook `onTransferReceived` on the Receiver Contract `ERC1363Receiver`
- functions `approveAndCall` calls the hook `onApprovalReceived` on the Spender Contract `ERC1363Spender`
- Interfaces `ERC1363Receiver` & `ERC1363Spender` enable calls after each function call
